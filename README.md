# partyup-prototype
Prototype for an iOS app called "PartyUp" for my Freshman Design Project at Drexel University

This app is designed to host and join local parties around the Drexel Univeristy campus. As of the prototype, almost anyone can register
and use the application. There are a lot of quirks that still need to be resolved, as this is only our prototype that we presented at the
end of the first course in the series of 2 courses at Drexel.
